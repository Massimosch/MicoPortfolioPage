        "Damnorak" was developed solo in 1.5 months for the BIT1 Game Dev Competition, focusing on core gameplay mechanics and architectural foundations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Key technical achievements:<br>
        • Implemented event-driven architecture for scalable system communication<br>
        • Applied OOP principles for maintainable and extensible code structure<br>
        • Developed procedural room generation algorithm for dynamic level creation<br>
        • Integrated Unity NavMesh for AI pathfinding and character navigation<br>
        • Created custom VFX systems for immersive gameplay feedback<br>
        <br>
        This project taught me the critical balance between rapid prototyping and sustainable development practices. Learning to allocate time effectively between planning, implementation, and iteration was the most valuable takeaway from this intensive solo development experience.
