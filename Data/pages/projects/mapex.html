        I had a solo development project in game development competition in Bit1 (2025).
        <br>
        <br>
        The inspiration for my game was to try implement few different algorithms. (A* pathfinding and room generation algorithm, similiar to the other Dungeon Crawler games.)
        <br>
        <br>
        I did use first time also abit AI in my game to generate some graphic and dialog speech, text.
        <br>
        <br>
        I feel like this project greatly increased my skills in how important game design is. Without a good plan of features and combat systems for game like this it will be very boring.
        <br>
        <br>
        Project also increased my skills in Unity and C# language pretty much. I understand after this project basic of VFX graphs, NavMesh basics, great use cases of "SO"s, scriptable objects. For example state machine States in this game was made in Scriptable objects.
