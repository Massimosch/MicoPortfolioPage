        <strong>Pitch:</strong><br>
        "Hazard Haul" is a sci-fi auto shooter game where players must survive waves of enemies across 5 different planets. Each planet presents unique challenges, and failure means retrying from the start. The game is downloadable on itch.io.

        <br>
        <strong>What i did:</strong><br>
        • Used Unity Engine with multiple Synty asset packs (Synty Sci-Fi City and others)<br>
        • Created a custom Timer System hooked directly into Unity's PlayerLoop<br>
        • Implemented delegates and event-driven communication systems for Scene switching, UI and Saving<br>
        • Applied generics for flexible, reusable code architecture (Generic singleton class for example)<br>
        • Utilized Unity NavMesh for AI pathfinding and enemy navigation<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong><br>
        • Solid understanding of C# generics and delegates<br>
        • Understanding of what is PlayerLoop system and what custom game systems we could inject there<br>
        • Fundamentals of OOP architecture and why to apply SOLID principles<br>
        • Shader programming basics and visual effects creation<br>
        • Event-driven architecture patterns<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Next Learning Goals:</strong><br>
        • LINQ for more efficient data queries<br>
        • Dependency Injection patterns<br>
        • Level design principles and playtesting methodologies<br>
        • Unity Editor API to create custom tools and solutions<br>
        • More shader programming techniques<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Final Reflection:</strong><br>
        This school project was developed solo as Portfolio Project 1 for my game development studies at Metropolia UAS. 
        It taught me the critical balance between rapid prototyping and sustainable development practices, 
        while solidifying my understanding of Unity game development fundamentals. The experience of building a complete game loop from scratch was invaluable for my growth as a developer.
        It was also eye-opening project of how difficult game development as a solo is.
