        This game was created within 1,5 months. It did work pretty well but did lack features alot!
        <br>
        <br>
        Solo game development project, i learned alot during this. (VFX, More about NavMesh in Unity, Room generation algorithm (Silly one but working.))
        <br>
        <br>
        "Damnorak" was a great project to try doing something by myself and realising how hard it is to create a game solo, and how much it takes time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bit1 was great opportunity to make a game solo and see how i can prepare for it next year.
