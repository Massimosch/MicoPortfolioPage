        <strong>Pitch:</strong><br>
        I participated in the BIT1 Game Dev Competition to challenge myself with
        testing how much i could accomplish solo with the skills i had. The result is "Damnorak" a 3D roguelite heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac.
        While admittedly a sloppy version of its inspiration, it was a valuable learning experience where i experimented with advanced systems like 
        procedural room generation and AI-assisted development.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What i did:</strong><br>
        • Developed a 3D roguelite game loop with procedural elements<br>
        • Built procedural room generation system (with AI assistance)<br>
        • Experimented with LLMs for voice and code generation<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong><br>
        • Delegates in C#<br>
        • Object-oriented programming principles<br>
        • Unity's NavMesh system for AI navigation<br>
        • Shader graph basics<br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>Final Reflection:</strong><br>
        This project taught me valuable lessons about both rapid prototyping and the limitations of AI assistance in development.
        While i learned a lot technically, the biggest takeaway was understanding how AI-assisted code can create technical debt if you don't fully grasp what it's doing.
        The tight deadline forced me to prioritize features and make tough decisions about scope, but relying too heavily on AI for complex systems like procedural generation created maintainability issues.
        Despite the challenges and the "sloppy" execution, i had fun and gained crucial insights that will inform my future development practices.
