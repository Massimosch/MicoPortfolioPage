  During my studies at Taitotalo, I worked at the meat and fish counter in K-SuperMarket, gaining valuable experience in customer service and responsibility.
  Later, as I transitioned to Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and welcomed my first child, I decided to focus fully on my game development studies.

  I started working here while I was studying at Taitotalo. It was easy to get a
